# Occupancy-of-Lacerta-viridis-
Data used analysis performed for [Prieto-Ramirez et al. (2020)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229600). It includes data on L. viridis occupancy and habitat loss at the core and periphery of the distribution range of the species. It contains two OpenOffice Calc files, one with the data of the core region and the other with data from the periphery. In each file there are 
two tables. The first table contains data on occupancy of the species, patch geometric variables, isolation, and landscape configuration variables. In the second table are the variables related to landscape composition and proximity index, all of which were measured at different spatial scale. Additionally, the Rscript for the analysis of the data applying occupancy models correcting for detection probability is also uploaded.
